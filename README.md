# Information and Cyber💻 Security Project
Implementing playfair cipher 🐱‍💻 algorithm having matrix size 4 x 19.

We (team of 4) developed a novel Cryptographic method wherein we leveraged the Traditional Playfair cipher algorithm by constructing a key square of size 4 x 19 in contrast to standard size of 5*5 and used the RSA algorithm along with the proposed novel technique - RMPS keyless transposition to further enhance the security and confidentiality of the message.
