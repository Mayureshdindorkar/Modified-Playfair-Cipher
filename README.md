# Information and Cyber💻 Security Project
Implementing playfair cipher 🐱‍💻 algorithm having matrix size 4 x 19.

We (team of 4) developed a novel Cryptographic method in which we customized the Traditional Playfair cipher algorithm by using a key square of size 4 x 19 instead of standard 5 x 5. We also blended it with RSA algorithm along with the proposed novel technique - RMPS keyless transposition to further improve the security of the message.
